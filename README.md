# OGRE-pipeline

This is the OGRE (One-Step General Registration and Extraction) pipeline, which is intended to be general-purpose for fMRI data (especially task fMRI) preprocessing. OGRE integrates FSL and FreeSurfer tools for registration, brain extraction, and preprocessing, for subsequent FSL FEAT statistical analysis on the Mac.
